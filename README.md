# AI Disease Prediction Model

## Overview
This AI model uses MobileNetV2 for disease detection through image analysis. It predicts whether a disease is present based on an uploaded image and provides the result via a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- **Pre-trained MobileNetV2 Model:** Used for binary classification (Disease vs. No Disease).
- **GUI Integration:** Built with `tkinter` to upload images and display results.
- **Image Preprocessing:** Resizes and normalizes images for model input.

## Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow**
- **Pillow**
- **tkinter**
- **Numpy**

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
```

## How to Use
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python face_recognition_attendance_system.py
   ```
2. Click "UPLOAD FILE" to select an image.
3. View the result (Disease Detected or No Disease).
